Some penny sweets or candy can make great input devices for a game using a Raspberry Pi. You will learn how to turn a squidgy sweet into an input button for your Raspberry Pi. You will then create a reaction game in Scratch that counts how many times a player can squeeze your sweet input device in ten seconds!
