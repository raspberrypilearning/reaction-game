## Design a sweet shop background

To make the game a little more interesting, let's set the scene by changing the background from the default white to something a little more exciting, like a gradient colour or sweets in a shop!

- Click on the **stage** icon next to the sprites palette to change the background.

- Next, locate the **backgrounds** tab and select it with your mouse.

- If you want to draw your own background, click on the **edit** button underneath the **background1** label: this will open the paint editor. Use the drawing tools to make a more interesting and colourful background.

	**Or**

 	If you would rather add a new background using an image, delete background1 by clicking on the **x** underneath the background1 label. Then click on the **import** button to use a background from the image library, or from a picture that you have saved.

- When you are happy with your background, click on **sprite1** in the sprites palette, ready to program the reaction game mechanics in the next step.
