## Wire up your sweet button

You will need to connect a sweet or piece of candy to your Raspberry Pi to act as an input device and test it.

- If you are using metal paper clips, unfold them to make straight wires.

- Insert the paper clip wire or dress pin into the end of a female-to-female jumper cable.

- Do the same to the other jumper cable so that the two cables are identical.

- Insert the paper clips into a soft sweet so that they are close to each other but not touching.

   The diagram above the pins shows the pin numbers. You will be using pin 3 and a `GND` pin.

- Take the other end of one of the jumper cables (not connected to a paper clip) and push onto pin 3 of the General Purpose Input-Output (GPIO) header, which is connected to one of the GPIO channels.

- Take the end of the other jumper cable and push onto a pin labelled 'GND' which is connected to ground.

    **Warning!** You can damage your Raspberry Pi if you do not use the GPIO pins correctly!

Remember that your sweet input device is not a real button and will not give accurate results for your game. It is just a bit of fun.
