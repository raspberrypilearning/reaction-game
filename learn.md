By making a sweet shop reaction game on your Raspberry Pi you will learn:
- how to turn a squidgy sweet into an input button
- how to use Scratch to sense when the sweet button is pressed
- how to program a game to record how many times the button has been pressed, using loops and variables.

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Design basic 2D and 3D assets](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/design/creator)
- [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
- [Use basic digital, analogue, and electromechanical components](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/creator)
